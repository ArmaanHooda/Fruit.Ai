## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (for styling and responsiveness)
- **JavaScript** (for client-side functionality)

### Backend
- **FastAPI** or **Flask** (Python framework for handling the API)
- **SQLite** (or any other lightweight database for FAQ storage)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed).
  
### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArmaanHooda/Fruit.Ai.git
   cd Fruit.Ai
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
   - You can use any server (e.g., `live-server`) to launch the frontend.
   - Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a browser.

3. **Run locally** (optional):
   If you are using a simple server for development, you can run the following command (if using Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm live-server
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   If you are using Flask, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Flask/ FastAPI app**:
   ```bash
   flask run  # for Flask
   uvicorn main:app --reload  # for FastAPI
   ```

3. **Access API**:
   The API will be available at:
   - `http://localhost:5000` for Flask
   - `http://localhost:8000` for FastAPI

### API Endpoints

## Future Enhancements
- **Authentication**: Implement real user authentication for login functionality.
- **Database Integration**: Replace the local SQLite database with a more robust cloud database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **More Services**: Extend the chatbot to include more fruit recommendations, interactive services, and AI-powered insights.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Further refine the UI for better aesthetics and usability across all devices.
